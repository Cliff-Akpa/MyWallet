## üìñ What Does It Do?

**MyWallet** allows you to easily monitor your capital flow.  

- You can create **wallets** that represent your different resources.  
  - Each wallet has a **name**, **currency**, **type**, **initial amount**, **current balance**, and even a customizable **color** for aesthetics.  

- Within each wallet, you can record both **incomes** and **expenses**.  
  - Each transaction includes a **category**, a **type** (income or expense), an **amount**, and an optional **description**.  

- Starting with two wallets, you can perform **transfers** between them.  
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è Both wallets must use the **same currency** for a transfer to work.  

- You can **archive** wallets you no longer need.  
  - Archived wallets are moved to the **Recycle Bin**, where you can choose to either **restore** them or **permanently delete** them.  
  - Deleting a wallet also deletes **all associated transactions**.  

- Both wallets and individual transactions can be **edited** or **deleted** at any time.  

- The app features an **offline login system** to enforce security.  
  - You can **log out** after finishing your session.  
  - You can also change your **profile picture**.  
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è If you forget your password after logging out, you will need to **reset the application**, which erases all your data. To avoid this, remember your password carefully ‚Äî or simply never log out.  

- A built-in **theme switcher** lets you personalize the app‚Äôs appearance to match your preferences.
